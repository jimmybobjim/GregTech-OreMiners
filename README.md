# GregTech OreMiners

A GregTechCEu Modern addon for Minecraft Forge 1.20.1

## Features
(This mod is still in the early stages of development, many features are yet to be implemented)
- ### Core Blocks
  - Every ore vein now generates with a single 'core' block towards its center
  - These can be mined by increasingly complex machinery, creating large quantities of that veins material, which can then be further refined through the traditional gregtech processes
  - Each core block has an associated tier, purity and remaining capacity that determine what tier ore miner must be used and the quantity of material extracted
- ### Ore Miners
  - Increasingly complex single and multi-block gregtech machines for mining core blocks
  - Each ore miner has an associated tier that determines what ore veins it can mine
- ### Compatibility
  - While the mod automatically generates core blocks for every existing gregtech vein, core blocks can be added to new veins through KubeJS
- ### Configurability
  - The extractable volume from each vein (up to infinity)
  - Full KubeJS support
